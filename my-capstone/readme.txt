What kind of cleaning steps did you perform?
● How did you deal with missing values, if any?
● Were there outliers? If so, how did you handle them?
● If your dataset is too large to work with, does it make sense to build your
prototype on a smaller subset of the data?

    Remove stop words
    Stemming/ Lemmatization
